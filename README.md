# Quizzical

## Purpose
I built this application to improve my React skills by creating an interactive UI that uses logic I had not yet had a chance to implement.

## Functionality
This application:

- Is a SPA
- Allows the user to choose a difficulty which is saved to localStorage.
- Fetches quiz data from Open Trivia DB API and displays questions and corresponding, clickable answers.
- Has a countdown that varies in duration for each difficulty and displays correct, incorrect and unanswered questions when the timer expires.
- Keeps track of the user's high score for each difficulty in localStorage and updates it when exceeded.
- Displays celebratory confetti when the user receives a perfect score on a quiz of any difficulty.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- SASS
- JavaScript
- React
